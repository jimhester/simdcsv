## Overview

libvroom is a high-performance CSV parser library using portable SIMD instructions via [Google Highway](https://github.com/google/highway), designed for future integration with R's [vroom](https://github.com/tidyverse/vroom) package.

The parser uses a speculative multi-threaded two-pass algorithm based on research by Chang et al. (SIGMOD 2019) and SIMD techniques from Langdale & Lemire (simdjson).

## Features

- **SIMD-accelerated parsing** using Google Highway for portable vectorization
- **Multi-threaded** speculative parsing for large files
- **Comprehensive error handling** with three modes: strict, permissive, and best-effort
- **Cross-platform** support for Linux and macOS (x86-64 and ARM)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jimhester/libvroom.git
cd libvroom

# Configure and build
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build

# Run tests
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
```

See the [Getting Started](getting-started.qmd) guide for more details.

## Architecture

The parser implements a two-pass algorithm:

1. **First Pass**: Scans for line boundaries while tracking quote parity to find safe chunk split points
2. **Second Pass**: SIMD-based field indexing using a state machine, processing 64 bytes at a time

Learn more in the [Architecture](architecture.qmd) documentation.

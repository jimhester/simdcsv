APPROVED

**Summary of changes:**
This commit adds tracking for suppressed errors when the ErrorCollector hits its `max_errors` limit. Key additions:

1. **New member `suppressed_count_`**: Tracks errors dropped after hitting the limit
2. **Updated `add_error()`**: Increments suppressed count instead of silently dropping
3. **Updated `merge_from()`**: Combines suppressed counts from both collectors and tracks errors that couldn't be copied due to limits
4. **New accessor methods**: `suppressed_count()` and `max_errors()`
5. **Updated `summary()`**: Reports suppressed errors with proper singular/plural grammar
6. **Updated `clear()`**: Resets suppressed count along with other state
7. **Comprehensive tests**: 10 new tests covering all suppression scenarios

**Code quality observations:**
- The `merge_from()` fix to propagate `has_fatal_` from empty collectors is a good catch
- Proper singular/plural handling in the summary message
- Suppressed count combination during merge is mathematically correct
- Thread-safety note in docs is appropriately maintained
- Tests cover edge cases well (empty collector with fatal, merge exceeding limit, etc.)

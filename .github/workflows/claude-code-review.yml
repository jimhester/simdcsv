            PR: #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            Perform a comprehensive code review covering three areas:

            ## 1. REQUIREMENTS COMPLIANCE
            - Read all CLAUDE.md files (root + directories with modified files) - do changes follow the guidance?
            - Get the PR description and any linked issue - do changes address what was requested?
            - Read inline code comments in modified files - do changes comply with guidance in comments?

            ## 2. BUG DETECTION
            - Get the PR diff and read the changed files
            - Look for obvious bugs in the changed lines (not pre-existing issues)
            - Check for logic errors, off-by-one, null pointer issues, resource leaks
            - Check for security issues (injection, overflow, etc.)

            ## 3. HISTORICAL CONTEXT
            - Use `git blame` and `git log` on modified files - are changes consistent with the code's history/intent?
            - Look for patterns that were intentionally established and might be broken

            IGNORE:
            - Style/formatting issues (linters catch these)
            - Missing tests (unless CLAUDE.md requires them)
            - Pre-existing issues not introduced by this PR
            - Nitpicks a senior engineer wouldn't flag

            Write ALL findings to /tmp/review-issues.json as a JSON array.
            Each issue should have: "category" (requirements|bug|history), "description", "source", "file", "line" (or null).
            If no issues, write: []

            Score code review findings and post a comment.

            First, read /tmp/findings/review-issues.json (if it exists).

            For each issue found, INDEPENDENTLY verify and score (0-100):
            - 0: False positive, doesn't hold up to scrutiny
            - 25: Might be real, but unverified
            - 50: Real but minor/nitpick
            - 75: Verified, impacts functionality
            - 100: Definitely real, will happen frequently

            You may read the referenced files and PR diff to verify issues.
            ONLY include issues scoring 80+.

            Use `gh pr comment` to post in this exact format:

            This is a FOLLOWUP review - Claude has already reviewed this PR before.
            Focus only on NEW changes since the last review.

            1. Get the PR diff to see current changes
            2. Look for obvious bugs in the new/modified code
            3. Check if new changes still follow CLAUDE.md guidance

            IGNORE:
            - Issues already flagged in previous Claude reviews
            - Style/formatting (linters handle this)
            - Pre-existing code not modified in recent commits

            Use `gh pr comment` to post:

            ### Followup review

            <If issues found>

            ...
            </If issues found>

            <If no issues>
            New changes look good. No issues found.
